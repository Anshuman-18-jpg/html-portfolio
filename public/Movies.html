<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Maharaja</h3>
<p>Too gruesome, brilliant screenplay</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Amazing Directing, Captivating Plot, Overall Great.</p>
<h3>Tummbad</h3>
<p>
    The constant rain, vivid local landscapes, unique storyline n the amazeballs ending. If only the subject of true horror 'Sati' was explored more.</p>
